Ethical AI Training Simulation

An interactive web-based tool designed to help learners explore and understand ethical decision-making in Artificial Intelligence. Through scenario-based simulations, users face ethical dilemmas, make choices, and see the consequences of their decisions in real time.

📌 Problem Statement

As AI becomes a part of healthcare, finance, education, and governance, ethical challenges such as bias, transparency, accountability, and privacy are growing.
Most current training resources are theoretical and do not provide learners with practical experience in handling ethical dilemmas.

🎯 Objectives

Provide a simulation-based environment to practice ethical decision-making in AI.

Make ethical principles interactive, engaging, and easy to understand.

Allow scalability to cover multiple domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, social media).

💡 Solution & Features

🌐 Web-based simulation: Easily accessible on browser.

🎮 Scenario-based learning: Users interact with AI dilemmas by making choices.

🔀 Multiple decision paths: Each decision leads to different ethical outcomes.

🧩 Modular design: Easy to add new scenarios and expand learning scope.

🎨 Modern UI/UX: Built with React & Next.js for smooth experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js (React + TypeScript)

Styling: CSS Modules / Global Styles

Components: Modular & reusable React components

Deployment: Vercel / Netlify (recommended)
